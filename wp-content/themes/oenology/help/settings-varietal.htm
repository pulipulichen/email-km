<h2>Varietals</h2><p>Varietals are the skins, or styles, applied to Oenology.</p><p>Just like the grapes used in winemaking, Oenology varietals take two forms: white and red.</p><ul>	<li><strong>White</strong> varietals are light skins: light backgrounds with dark foregrounds.</li>	<li><strong>Red</strong> varietals are dark skins: dark backgrounds with light foregrounds.</li></ul><p>The default varietal is <em>Chardonnay</em>. A versatile varietal for food-wine pairings, and a versatile varietal for Themes, Chardonnay adds just a touch of color and style.</p><p>Oenology also comes pre-packaged with a completely blank-slate varietal, <em>Cuvee</em>. This varietal adds a bare-minumum of style, and is well-suited as a template for custom Theme skins via Child Theme.</p>
